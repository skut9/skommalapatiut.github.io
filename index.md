I am a Ph.D. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin, where I am advised by [Prof. Robert Moser](https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Robert-Moser/). My research focuses on General Turbulence modeling using Deep Reinforcement learning. I'm also a student researcher at [Google](https://research.google/) working with the Anthromet to improve weather predictions using Deep learning. 

Before beginning my Ph.D., I was a predoctoral researcher in Machine Learning at [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/). Before that, I received my MS in Mechanical Engineering at the [University of Washington, Seattle](http://www.washington.edu/), where I worked on exploring wall-bounded turbulent flow using deep learning and coherent structure analysis.
