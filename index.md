I am a Ph.D. student in the Mechanical Engineering department at the University of Texas at Austin, where I am advised by <a href="https://oden.utexas.edu/people/directory/Robert-Moser/" target="blank">Prof. Robert Moser</a>. My research focuses on general Turbulence modeling using Deep Reinforcement learning. I'm also a Student Researcher at <a href="https://research.google/" target="blank">Google Research</a> working with the Anthromet team to improve weather predictions using Deep learning.

Before beginning my Ph.D., I was a predoctoral researcher in Machine Learning at
<a href="https://www.anl.gov/" target="blank">Argonne National Laboratory</a>. Before that, I received my MS in Mechanical Engineering at the 
<a href="[https://www.anl.gov/](http://www.washington.edu/)" target="blank">University of Washington, Seattle</a>, where I worked on exploring wall-bounded turbulent flow using deep learning and coherent structure analysis.
